# Findings 
* The government sector brings in the most profit of 11.4 million while the entreprise sector being the least brings in a loss of -0.6 million
* United states os America generates the most sales while Germany generates the most profit
* The government sector sold the most units of goods hence making them the most profitable
* Product Paseo made the most sales and has the most unit sold in terms of product hence it is the most profitable product
* Canada has the most sold product in terms of unit
* Sales are at the highest in october

# Recommendation
* More attention should be paid to the entreprise section in order to find ways of minimalising the loss and making profit
* United states needs to be investigated on why they make the most sales but the are not bringing in the most profit, price of goods could be increased to generate more profit.
* More goods should be produced towards the month of october in order to maximise sales and profit
